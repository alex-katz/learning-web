        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><b>Best Hamburger Patty Recipe</b> - Thick or thin, made on the grill or stovetop, this is the best and easiest all-purpose recipe for perfect hamburger patties every time! These juicy, delicious homemade hamburgers are ready in less than 30 minutes and are a must-make for your next cookout.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ground chuck</b> – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
            <li><b>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</b> - The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
            <li><b>Worcestershire sauce</b> - Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Egg</b> - To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
            <li><b>Milk</b> - The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
            <li><b>Seasonings</b> - Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly oil grill and heat BBQ to medium.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg in a bowl and add next 6 ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.</li>
            <li>Crumble in beef using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.</li>
            <li>Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.</li>
            <li>Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.</li>
            <li>Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
            <li>Place burgers on the grill, close lid BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>An instant read thermometer should read 160F.</li>
            <li>Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!</li>
            <li>Tuck into a warm crusty bun and add your favourite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
